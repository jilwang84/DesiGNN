The Flickr dataset originates from NUS-wide. This dataset is built by forming links between images sharing common metadata from Flickr. Edges are formed between images from the same location, submitted to the same gallery, group, or set, images sharing common tags, images taken by friends, etc. The original images are collected from PASCAL, ImageCLEF, MIR, and NUS-wide. It generated an undirected graph. One node in the graph represents one image uploaded to Flickr. If two images share some common properties (e.g., same geographic location, same gallery, comments by the same user, etc.), there is an edge between the nodes of these two images. We use the 500-dimensional bag-of-word representation of the images provided by NUS-wide as the node features. For labels, we scanned over the 81 tags of each image and manually merged them into 7 classes. Each image belongs to one of the 7 classes. In summary, its statistics contain 500 features, and 7 single classes.
